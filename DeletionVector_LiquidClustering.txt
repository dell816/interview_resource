Liquid Clustering

Liquid clustering in Delta Lake is a dynamic data layout optimization that automatically reorganizes files based on query patterns instead of fixed partitions.
It improves query performance and reduces maintenance by continuously adapting clustering as data and access patterns change.

In the background, Delta Lake tracks query access patterns and file-level statistics, then incrementally rewrites small or poorly organized files to colocate related data. This happens automatically during writes or OPTIMIZE operations, without rigid partitions or full table rewrites.

helps improve performance for data with high Cardinality

Deletion vector

In a normal scenario, when we modify data in a particular parquet file, the whole parquet file will be rewritten. Consider we have millions rows in a file,
and we just want to modify one record. This is an optimization issue. with deletion vector, a flag would be added to your row, and the file will not be rewritten
and will be flagged as deleted. When you read a file, only rows will be read which marked flag not deleted. next time when you run maintenance which is
Optimized, or predictive optimize command, the file will be rewritten.
