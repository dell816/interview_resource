This video provides a comprehensive tutorial on data skew in Apache Spark, a common issue in big data processing that can significantly degrade performance.

Here's a breakdown of the key takeaways:

What is Data Skew? Data skew refers to the uneven distribution of data across partitions, meaning some partitions contain significantly more data than others (0:15).
How to Identify Data Skew:
Spark jobs getting stuck at the last task, taking an abnormally long time to complete (0:40).
Examining the event timeline in Spark UI, where one partition shows a much longer executor computing time (1:20).
Observing a huge gap between the minimum and maximum task processing times in the summary metrics for your tasks (2:01).
When and Why Does Data Skew Happen?
Data skew occurs when data is not evenly distributed across partitions, leading to some cores sitting idle while one core is heavily overloaded (2:28).
This results in uneven resource utilization and paying for idle resources (3:55).
Operations that Cause Data Skew:
Aggregation operations (e.g., groupBy) where certain keys have a much higher count of records (4:27). For example, grouping by country where one country has significantly more transactions (4:40).
Join operations where the join key has a highly uneven distribution of values (5:28). For instance, joining on a product_ID where one product_ID appears far more frequently (5:51).
Why is Data Skew Bad?
Increased job completion time, leading to longer development and debugging cycles (6:18).
Uneven utilization of resources, meaning you pay for resources that are not actively working (6:47).
Potential for out-of-memory errors or data spills, which are costly operations that involve writing data to disk (7:09).
Code Example to Simulate Skewed Dataset: The video demonstrates how to simulate both a uniform dataset (8:02) and a skewed dataset (9:05) using PySpark, showing how to identify the uneven distribution of rows per partition. It also illustrates a skewed join scenario by examining the distribution of a join key (customer ID) before performing the join and observing the skewed partition in the Spark UI (9:49).
Solutions for Data Skew: The video briefly mentions solutions like AQE (Adaptive Query Execution), broadcast join, and salting, which are discussed in detail in other videos in the creator's playlist
